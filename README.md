I always wished Google Docs had a highlight shortcut, so I made my own.

This is a Firefox extension for adding a keybind for highlighting Google Docs.

Default keybind is ctrl+alt+h. You can change it by going about:addons in Firefox, selecting the gear icon on the top right, click "Manage Extension Shortcuts" and adding your keybind there. 

If the keybind you want is already taken by Firefox (I wanted ctrl+shift+h, but Firefox defaults that to the history manager), go to about:keyboard, find the action for the keybind you want, and clear/edit the keybind to something else. Once the keybind is available, repeat the top steps to enable the keybind.
